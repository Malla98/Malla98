## About Me

I architect and deliver high-performance backend systems and full-stack applications for mission-critical domains—payments, financial platforms, and distributed infrastructure. My work spans designing fault-tolerant microservices, integrating third-party financial APIs, and scaling cloud-native applications under real-world production load.

I focus on **reliability, performance, and operational excellence**—writing systems that process transactions, handle concurrency safely, and run predictably in production.
